Arachne 0.2
Sophie Weidmann Nov 12 2025
Max Weidmann helped as a rubber ducky and demands credit.

This code is for a servo-controlled dobby loom I call Arachne, because of both its and my hubris! 
The loom is capable of both leading and following, in that it can treadle for the pattern you give it, or it can act independently.
Currently it's capable of designing a random weave, edited for structural stability. 

This code is for 8 harnesses, but should be fine to pattern out <8 and just leave a servo or two inactive. 
More harnesses will require more servos, more memory, more microcontroller pins, and more amperage, but is theoretically entirely plausible.

Future plans involve:
Building a library of treadling patterns for glitch mode to riff off of.
Adding a little knob/dial/potentiometer for switching between treadling presets on the fly?
Giving it a little display for pick count, error codes, and personality!

Pinouts:
  toggle switch (single pole, triple throw) glitch mode: 4
  toggle switch (single pole, triple throw) pattern mode: 5
    leave third throw disconnected as an "off" position

  pick advance pedal: 6

  servos (in order): 10, 16, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21
    don't blame me, that's sequential on the pro micro. I'm disgruntled by it, too.

  the sensor of your choice (I'm using a DHT20 for humidity) is connected via I2C (pins 2 and 3 on pro micro)
